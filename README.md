Project Title
AI‑ML Prompt Engineering Lab

Student Information
Name: Ruben
Course: Data Programming / AI Foundations
Assignment: Prompt Engineering Lab

Company Selection
For this assignment, I selected Vaya Health, a behavioral healthcare organization that provides managed care and data‑driven support services across multiple states. The role chosen for analysis is:

Role: Technical Analyst (Remote)
Company: Vaya Health
Source: Indeed.com
Link: https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Technical+Analyst+Vaya+Health+Remote&l=&from=searchOnDesktopSerp&vjk=e6825c4284a32331
Location: Remote (multi‑state)
Salary Range: $79,354.10 – $103,160.33 per year

Why This Role Fits My Field (Data Programming)
The Technical Analyst position directly aligns with the Data Programming field because it includes several responsibilities that involve working with data, reporting, and software development processes. Key field‑related responsibilities from the job description include:

🔹 Data Analysis & Reporting
Performing ad hoc data analysis to support business needs

Pulling data extracts from internal systems

Supporting operational reporting and data‑driven decision‑making

🔹 Business Intelligence & Data Systems
Strong knowledge of Business Intelligence (BI) and reporting solutions

Working with data warehousing and data science teams

Creating prototype systems and reports as proof‑of‑concepts

🔹 Requirements Engineering & SDLC
Defining and documenting business processes

Writing requirements documents and technical specifications

Participating in testing, validation, and development lifecycle activities

🔹 Cross‑Functional Data Work
Collaborating with MIS, developers, and stakeholders

Ensuring data‑related requirements are met throughout development

Supporting data workflows across multiple business units

These responsibilities match core skills taught in data programming, including data workflows, analytics, requirements gathering, and supporting data‑driven software development.

This makes the role an excellent fit for the assignment’s objectives.

Project Description
This repository contains all deliverables for the AI‑ML Prompt Engineering Lab, including:

LLM selection and justification

Initial prompt and three iterative refinements

Model comparison across iterations

Final SWOT analysis (PDF)

Prompt_Revisions.docx documenting the evolution of prompts

The purpose of this project is to explore how different large language models respond to iterative prompt refinement and to evaluate their usefulness in analyzing a real job posting in the data programming field.
